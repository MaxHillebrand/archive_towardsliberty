:::danger Natural Law is simple 
Do NOT kill. || Do NOT assualt. || Do NOT steal. || Do NOT trespass. || Do NOT coerse. || Do NOT rape. || Do NOT lie.
:::

Fundamentally, `do NOT violate the private property of another peaceful sovereign individual`. Any action that does not harm others is in accordance to Natural Law and thus morally rightous and mutually beneficial. Natural Law is a set of universal, inherent, objective, non-man-made, eternal and immutable conditions, that govern the consequence of behavior of beings with the capacity for understanding the differences between harmful and non-harmful action.

Anarchy is derived from the Greek prefix "an-": "without; the absence of" and the Greek noun "archon": "external master; ruler". It does not mean no rules, rather, it means without imposed rulers, no masters and no slaves, in other words, Freedom. Anarchy is in opposition to authority or the state, as these terms are simply euphemisms for aggression and theft, which are always immoral and in opposition to Natural Law. There is no legitimacy to the mastery over other people.
