Austrian Economics is a sub dicipline of praxeology, the axiomatic science of purposeful Human action to remove uneasiness in times of uncertainty. It is a logical method to discover Natural Law and morality in economics, by analyzing both the isolated individual & the economy of interpersonal exchange of scarce goods. The free market is fundamentally based on voluntary action unhampered by aggression or the threat thereof. Due to asymmetric individual preference hierarchies, peaceful trade is always mutually beneficial and a proven method to allocate scarce resources to the most desired needs in deep production stages.
