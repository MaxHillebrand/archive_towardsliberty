# Bitcoin Archive

Bitcoin is open source sound money that emerges out of the free and peaceful market, with sovereign nodes declaring their individual monetary rules, presenting themselves to a network of peers and enforcing consensus rules. With a hard and predictable monetary base and equal opportunity for any individual to enter the market of money production, there is no institutionalized theft via inflation. Thus, Bitcoin is true market anarchy and freedom.
