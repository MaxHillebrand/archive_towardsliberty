# Bitcoin Full Node

Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system.
The important aspect is peer-to-peer, that is that the individual user has full control over the system, and doesn’t delegate the power to a centralized party.
However, the system is truly trust less, if and only if the individual user runs a full node.
This is a piece of software that can be freely installed on any hardware, computer, dedicated device like the, or a smartphone.
Ultimately, the end user could write this software from scratch, but this is of course very complex and not reasonable to assume.
There are several different clients already, that can be used in order to communicate with the rest of the network, the most advanced of these software is the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) client.
It is 100% open source, each and every line code can be seen, copied, changed and improved by anyone, without asking for permission, thus everyone can verify the entire software.

When downloading the Bitcoin clients, the user can set any kind of individual rule that she wants.
She could increase the number of bitcoin in existence, change the proof-of-work algorithm, change the network routing, or take away control from another UTXO and give herself the control over these coins.
There are literally no restrictions on the individual user, she can change anything and everything she wants.

Once the rules are set, the node introduces itself to the network and queries for other nodes to communicate with.
The users node will receive lots of information from many different participants, and she herself will verify the adherence to her rules authoritatively.
When the incoming block is valid, for example the coin base reward is 50 bitcoin, halving every 210 000 blocks, she will store it on her harddrive.
However, if according to the users rules, the transaction proposed is invalid, for example a double spend, her node will reject it, block the sending node, and tell her peers about the malicious actor.
The user does not need to trust anyone in the validation process, as she has full access and control of the source code rule set.
This is a self sovereign node, a monarch, a single Ruler who rules only The Kingdom of Self.
Sovereignty is a state in which one controls one’s own thoughts [individual rules], emotions [verification of these rules], and actions [enforcement of these rules].
