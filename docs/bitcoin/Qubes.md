## Introduction

[Qubes](https://qubes-os.org) is a reasonably secure operating system.
It is a free and open source software with a focus on secure compartmentalization and serious privacy.
The design goal is to separate different parts of your cyberspace life into independent virtual machines.
It is like having a dedicated computer for browsing the web, another for running chat apps, and another to do work related tasks.
If one of the computer breaks or gets compromised, then the others are not affected.
However, instead of needing to buy new hardware for each task, the separation is done inside the operating system on one physical computer.

Checkout the very thorough [Qubes documentation](https://qubes-os.org/docs) for in depth analysis and guides on the whole OS.
